# "Computer, Enhance!" homework, in Zig

This is my collection of solutions to the [Computer, Enhance!](https://www.computerenhance.com) course on Substack - a course on "performance-aware programming".

All of the solutions are in [Zig](https://ziglang.org) 0.12.0 and may not work in recent releases (Zig is pre-1.0 and is expected to have breaking changes).

Everything here worked for me at some point and was useful for learning the course material.
